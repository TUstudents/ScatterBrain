# scatterbrain/modeling/__init__.py
"""
The modeling subpackage for ScatterBrain.

This package contains modules for defining and fitting scattering models,
including form factors and structure factors.

Modules
-------
form_factors
    Defines various analytical form factors P(q).
structure_factors
    (Future) Defines various structure factors S(q).
