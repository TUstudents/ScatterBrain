Okay, let's formally step through Phase 0: Foundation & Planning for the `ScatterBrain` project, using the `ScatterBrain` Design Document we've just created as the primary reference. This phase ensures we have a solid plan before writing code.

As per the SOP (Section II, Item 1) and the `ScatterBrain` Design Document (Section 8.1):

**Phase 0: Foundation & Planning**

1.  **Recapitulate Existing Knowledge:**
    *   **Objective:** Briefly summarize known information, existing tools, and key challenges in the SAXS/WAXS domain.
    *   **Fulfillment:** This is addressed in the `ScatterBrain` Design Document, Section 8.1 ("Phase 0: Foundation & Planning" -> "Recap Existing Knowledge"). It notes existing software (SasView, RAW, etc.), relevant Python libraries (`pyFAI`), and common challenges (data format diversity, usability, integrating analysis steps).
    *   **Status:** Addressed.

2.  **Define Scope (Initial & Long-Term):**
    *   **Objective:** Clearly delineate what will be included in the first functional version (MVP) and what are future enhancements.
    *   **Fulfillment:** This is detailed in the `ScatterBrain` Design Document, Section 2:
        *   Section 2.1: "Initial Scope (Minimum Viable Product - MVP / First Major Release)"
        *   Section 2.2: "Long-Term Scope / Vision"
    *   **Status:** Addressed.

3.  **Draft High-Level Design Document:**
    *   **Objective:** Outline core modules, data flow, key algorithms/models to be used, and I/O.
    *   **Fulfillment:** The entirety of the **`ScatterBrain`: Design Document** (which we just completed) serves this purpose. Key sections include:
        *   Section 3: "High-Level Architecture" (describes conceptual data flow).
        *   Section 5: "Module Specifications" (outlines `io`, `reduction`, `processing`, `analysis`, `modeling`, `visualization`, `utils`).
        *   Key algorithms/models are mentioned within module specifications (e.g., Guinier, Porod, sphere form factor).
    *   **Status:** Addressed. The Design Document *is* this deliverable.

4.  **Outline Core Data Structures:**
    *   **Objective:** Define the primary Python classes that will represent the main entities in the domain.
    *   **Fulfillment:** This is detailed in the `ScatterBrain` Design Document, Section 4: "Core Data Structures." It defines:
        *   `ScatteringCurve1D` (for initial focus)
        *   `SAXSImage` / `WAXSImage` (Future)
        *   `ScatteringExperiment` (Future)
    *   **Status:** Addressed.

5.  **Plan Directory Structure:**
    *   **Objective:** Establish a standard project layout from the start.
    *   **Fulfillment:** This is detailed in the `ScatterBrain` Design Document, Section 6: "Directory Structure." It provides a specific layout for `ScatterBrain`.
    *   **Status:** Addressed.

**Conclusion of Phase 0:**

With the comprehensive `ScatterBrain`: Design Document completed, all objectives of Phase 0: Foundation & Planning have been met. We have:
*   A clear understanding of the project's context and goals.
*   A defined scope for initial and long-term development.
*   A high-level architectural design, including module breakdowns and core data structures.
*   A planned directory structure.

This solid foundation allows us to proceed to Phase 1 with confidence.

**Next Step (Transition to Phase 1):**

The first step in **Phase 1: Core Skeleton Implementation** is typically to set up the project infrastructure and implement the most basic core data structures.

According to the SOP (Section II, Item 2) and the `ScatterBrain` Design Document (Section 8.2, Task 1 & 2):
1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize Git repository, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, basic `docs/source/conf.py` and `index.rst`.
2.  **Core Data Structures:** Implement `scatterbrain.core.ScatteringCurve1D` with basic attributes, `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `copy()`.

Would you like to proceed with the first task of Phase 1, which is setting up the basic project files, starting with the `pyproject.toml` file?
